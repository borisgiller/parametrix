Create a webpage that would be hosted in a gitrepository /pages that has has 2 huge buttons that links to 2 google forms; to enter expenses and income. It's for a company named Parametrix. It should also have a favicon since ulitmately i'd like this page to be a neat icon on each person in the company's phone's homescreen.
